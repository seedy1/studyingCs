    <h2>What To Find Inside This page</h2>
        <p id="details">It talks about the benefits of studying computer science and places that will help you get started with free
            course materials and online lecture.
    </p>
    <article>.... </article>

    <h2>benefits of studying computer science</h2>
    <p class="intro">The demand for computer scientist and engineers is at an all time high. More companies, not just
    tech companies, are now interested in them. From software engineers to web developers to database managers,
    our demand is high and its continually increasing. This is due to the rise in technological infrastructure like laptops
    which I assume that 1 in people have.</p>

        <ol class="list-group">
            <li><p class="list-group-item"> You can work in almost an company or organization because they will need
                someone to manage their database systems or web sites their in company app
                or even build one if it is not yet available. Computers are found in every organization lately so if
                you want to work in agriculture or finance instead of a tech computer, YOU SURELY CAN.</p></li>

            <li><p class="list-group-item">You get the chance to make the world a better place by software design which helps people
                do work better, faster and more reliable. Although this impact can be larger working in a big
                tech company like FACEBOOK, GOOGLE, MICROSOFT or DROPBOX, You can create your own software to solve problems
            that you think will help people. All software are designed to solve a set of problems lets not forget. For Instance,
            you can establish a start-up company to solve a particular problem, either for profit or non-profit you will still
                get a good cash-return and end up making money. </p></li>

            <li><p class="list-group-item">INTERNSHIPS which exposes us to real life work situation and experience are very
            common in the computer science field of study. You can get an internship almost anywhere just like the
            job opportunities mentioned above. Some companies even pay their interns. There is also a high chance that you
            can get a job at one of the places you once interned.</p></li>

            <li><p class="list-group-item">These are just few of the benefits but there are way more and others keep coming as
                the technology division keeps improving. </p> </li>

        <h2><abbr title="object oriented programming">OPP</abbr> where abouts(PROGRAMMING)</h2>
    <p class="intro">This is the most common branch of computer science which many people are concentrating on. It is is normally referred to
    as programming/coding/software engineering. Its where you hear many programmings languages like; JavaScript, Ruby, Java,
        Objective-C, PHP, Phyton and HTML &amp; CSS just to name a few. There are a lot more of these programming languages.
        Every computer science major should take at least one OOP class.</p>
    <p>Some of the problems that Freshman who hav never coded before face in these class are;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p class="list-group-item">My first Java class was not so bad at all because i read and watch videos on it online. To others
                    it seemed like learning Chinese for the first time as an English man. It is advisable to know a little
                    about a class( especially one that deals with OOP) before attending a lecture or it will be very difficult especially
                    if it is your first programming class.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="list-group-item">Learn by doing codes by yourself and don't copy paste from a text book. Most importantly if you are
                    suppose to submit a project written in a particular language <strong>do not</strong> copy codes from the internet
                    and present them as your own. This is a bad practice no CS student should ever do. The lecturer usually
                    finds out most of the time that you didn't write the code and penalties usually occur.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="list-group-item"></p>
                </li>
            </ol>
    <!--TODO also look for more where abouts-->
        <p>If you are good at programming then you can only face tiny difficulties during your period of study.</p>
    <br/>
    <hr/>
        <h2>having fun with school projects</h2>
    <p class="intro">Writing cool projects whether in a programming class or web class or database class or operating systems class
        is more fun than you can imagine. You may be given a specific idea to work on or you get to choose what you want to
    build, either way you will enjoy it a lot. What you build at the end and you will get a real life work experience. Well sort of because
    these applications can be used in your resume. You can even upload of the web for people to use. Computer science is
    one of few other fields of study that offers this experience while still in school. You can also build a portfolio and
    link all your projects. This can be used in place of a resume 90% of the time.</p>

        <p>How these projects helps us to......</p>
    <ol class="list-group">
        <li>
            <p class="list-group-item">Employers can hire you based on your projects alone if they are terrific and you can convince
                them you made it during a interview if there is one..</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="list-group-item">Less training is needed once hired as you have already worked on projects and you known how to
                go about them. Training starts in the classroom, lecture 1.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="list-group-item">think of something</p>

    <!--places to learn a few things if code bla bla-->

        <h2>places to get started</h2>
    <p>There are many places online where you can learning computer science for free. These materials are great and they give you
    all the information you need to know but it is not <strong>equivalent</strong> to a college/university degree. If you
    love computer science you can enroll in a university and use these online materials to boost your underspending
    in a particular area or concept. Although most of these online sites/materials focus on computer programming, there
    are some that focus on the non-programming parts such as ALGORITHMS AND CRYPTOGRAPHY which are also important. </p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
                <img src="../images/code_aca-logo.png" alt="code academy logo" class="img-thumbnail"/>
                <p>One of my favorite sites to learn coding before taking the actual class is code academy. They have a variety of
                    programming courses like HTML/CSS, JavaScript, ruby and ruby on rails, PHP, SQL
                    Python and Java. They also teach some important frameworks like JQuery, Angular JS and ruby on rails. You also get to
                    work with some <abbr title="application programming interface">APIs</abbr> and the interesting command line
                    and the mysterious Git.

            <p>
                Khan academy has a vast vault of information for interested learners of-course they have not forgotten the
                computer science field. You can learn about algorithms, cryptography( how we protect our private information),
                information theory( how information is  encoded and compressed) and how the internet works. You can also learn
                 HTML/CSS and make web pages and drawing using javaScript &amp; procession JS which is awesome.

            <img src="../images/codeorg_logo.png" alt="code dot org" class="img-thumbnail"/>
            <p> Code Org is a site that aims to encourage people, particularly school students
                to learn computer science. Code Org has courses for students from kindergraden to university level.
                 In 2013 they launched <strong>the hour code</strong> which is a one hour introduction to computer science,
                designed to demystify code and show that anyone can learn the basics.

    <p>There are a lot of matreials out there apart from the ones above that can help you learn computer science. You can start
        anywhere so you don't have to worry about where to start as all skills will come in handy in the near future.</p>
<!--<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus">hh</span>-->

    <p>Those who are not interested in programming can always try out other areas such as networking or data analyst, there
    are more areas in computer science you can imagine apart from programming.</p>
